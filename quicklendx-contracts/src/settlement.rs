//! Invoice settlement with partial payments, capped overpayment handling,
//! durable per-payment storage records, and finalization safety guards.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - `total_paid <= total_due` is enforced at every payment recording step.
//! - Settlement finalization is idempotent: once `status == Paid`, further
//!   settlement attempts are rejected.
//! - `investor_return + platform_fee == total_paid` is asserted before fund
//!   disbursement to prevent accounting drift.
//! - Payment count cannot exceed `MAX_PAYMENT_COUNT` per invoice.
//!
//! # Settlement-Dispute Interaction Invariants
//!
//! ## Critical Safety Property: Mutual Exclusion
//! **Settlement finalization is BLOCKED while `dispute_status != DisputeStatus::None`.**
//!
//! ### Rationale
//! Disputes represent contested invoice states. Allowing settlement during disputes could:
//! - Release funds to a party later determined to be in breach
//! - Create irreversible state contradicting dispute resolution
//! - Prevent proper refund pathways for the disadvantaged party
//!
//! ### Implementation
//! The `ensure_payable_status()` guard enforces that settlement requires
//! `invoice.status == InvoiceStatus::Funded`. When a dispute is active, the invoice
//! either:
//! 1. Remains `Funded` but has `dispute_status != None` (requires explicit check)
//! 2. Transitions to a dispute-specific status (automatically blocks settlement)
//!
//! **Current behavior**: Settlement checks status only. If disputes leave invoice in
//! `Funded` status, an **additional explicit dispute check is required**:
//! ```ignore
//! if invoice.dispute_status != DisputeStatus::None {
//!     return Err(QuickLendXError::DisputeActive);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Partial Payments During Disputes
//! `record_payment()` continues to function during disputes to:
//! - Track business good-faith payment attempts
//! - Provide payment history for dispute resolution
//! - Avoid hostile user experience (blocking all payments)
//!
//! However, `settle_invoice_internal()` will block finalization, so `total_paid` may
//! reach `invoice.amount` without triggering settlement completion.
//!
//! ### Escrow Safety During Disputes
//! - Escrow release requires `invoice.status == Paid` (unreachable during dispute)
//! - Escrow refund requires `invoice.status == Cancelled/Refunded`
//! - Dispute resolution determines which outcome (release vs. refund) becomes available
//!
//! **See**: `docs/settlement-dispute-interaction.md` for complete state machine and
//! resolution outcome mappings.
//!
//! ## Dispute Resolution Outcomes
//!
//! ### 1. Resolution in Favor of Investor
//! - Admin transitions invoice to `Cancelled` or `Refunded`
//! - Escrow refund becomes available via `refund_escrow()`
//! - Settlement permanently blocked
//! - **Guarantee**: Investor recovers principal; business does not receive funds
//!
//! ### 2. Resolution in Favor of Business
//! - Invoice returns to `Funded` (or equivalent settleable state)
//! - Business completes remaining payments
//! - Settlement proceeds normally via `settle_invoice()`
//! - **Guarantee**: Investor receives agreed returns; platform receives fees
//!
//! ### 3. Neutral Resolution
//! - Platform policy applies (settlement proceeds, partial refund, or mediation)
//! - **Guarantee**: No permanent fund freeze; deterministic resolution path provided
//!
//! ## Testing
//! Comprehensive integration tests validate:
//! - Settlement blocked during `Disputed` and `UnderReview` statuses
//! - Escrow double-spend prevention during state transitions
//! - Refund pathway integrity after investor-favorable resolution
//! - Settlement unblock after business-favorable resolution
//!
//! **See**: `src/test_settlement_dispute_interaction.rs` for complete test matrix.
